Hi! I'm Paul. I am a masters student in Informatics at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I am intersted in all things learning, of silicon and biological nature.

I have a strong background in Deep Learning, with my Bachelor's thesis on model compression achieving an 80% mark. For my Master's thesis I am currently researching optimisers for the distributed training of deep neural networks.

For more details, see my previous work [below](#previous-work).

When I'm not studying or researching deep learning methods, I am probably on a runüèÉ, taking photosüì∑ or hiking through the Scottish highlands‚õ∞Ô∏è.


## Research Interests
<!-- TODO: Links to intersting papers -->
- Foundational Deep Learning Methods  
    (Architectures, Training paradigms, Model compression, etc.)
- Computational Molecular Biology
- Computational Neuroscience: Biologically grounded models of cognition, behaviour and illnesses
- Natural Language Processing


## Current research

- Distributed optimisation of Deep Neural Networks.  
_Part of my Master's thesis with Hao Tang._

- Leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the automated determination of parameter sets for 3D meshes, particularly for a [novel spectral coarsening algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01146v2). This approach is aimed at expediting the computation of mesh parameters, to improve the efficiency of physics simulations on these meshes while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Previously, this task involved computationally expensive high-dimensional optimization methods, which the GNN method significantly accelerates.  
_Part of my research internship with Kartic Subr._
