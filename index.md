<!-- ## About Me -->

<!-- TODO: quick description -->
Hi! I'm Paul. I am a masters student in Informatics at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I am intersted in all things learning, of silicon and biological nature.

I have a strong background in deep learning, with my Bachelor's thesis on model compression achieving an 80% mark. For my Master's thesis I am currently researching optimisers for the distributed training of deep neural networks.

For more details, see my [previous work](#previous-work).

When I'm not studying or researching deep learning methods, I am probably on a runüèÉ, taking photosüì∑ or hiking through the Scottish highlands‚õ∞Ô∏è.


## Research Interests
<!-- TODO: Links to intersting papers -->
- Foundational Deep Learning Methods  
    (Architectures, Training paradigms, Model compression, etc.)
- Computational Molecular Biology
- Computational Neuroscience: Biologically grounded models of cognition, behaviour and illnesses
- Natural Language Processing
