Hi! I'm Paul. I am a PhD student in the [Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), focusing on _Modular and Efficient Deep Learning for NLP_ under supervision by [Ivan Vuliƒá](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/home) and [Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/).

I previously obtained my Master of Informatics (MInf) in 2024 from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I worked on Distributed Training and Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation under supervision by [Hao Tang](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/htang2/).

<!-- For more details, see my previous work [below](#previous-work). -->

When I'm not studying or researching deep learning methods, I am probably on a runüèÉ, taking photosüì∑ or travelling somewhere‚õ∞Ô∏è.


## Research Interests
<!-- TODO: Links to interesting papers -->
- Modular Deep Learning (e.g. merging models without retraining)
- Parameter-efficiency in training, fine-tuning and inference (e.g. adapters, MoEs)
- Training paradigms for efficient and distributed training
- Computational Neuroscience: Biologically grounded models of cognition, behaviour and illnesses
<!-- - Computational Molecular Biology & Drug Discovery -->


<!-- ## Current research -->

<!-- - Leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the automated determination of parameter sets for 3D meshes, particularly for a [novel spectral coarsening algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01146v2). This approach is aimed at expediting the computation of mesh parameters, to improve the efficiency of physics simulations on these meshes while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Previously, this task involved computationally expensive high-dimensional optimisation methods, which the GNN method significantly accelerates.
